In order to analyze the data and generate insights that will help Spotify outperform its competition, we have taken inspiration from Spotify’s current system. Spotify’s current system combines its exploratory analysis, its popularity prediction, and its recommendation system. While Spotify uses various tools and metrics to create its business moat through data and algorithms, we have used Tableau for our exploratory data analysis and Python to build the predictors & recommenders. Throughout our project, we aim to replicate Spotify’s approach on a smaller scale. Our objective was to understand the complexities of analyzing such data and the non-trivial challenges surrounding this approach of using data and machine learning.
